# GSOC 2017: Webservices in Joomla 4

*Welcome to the Joomla! Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2017 project: Webservices in Joomla 4!*

* Project Description: Integrating a rest API endpoint (like API/) into the Joomla Core. More information is going to follow in the next days.
* Expected Results: Working REST API for the core. Including com_content as the reference implementation.
* Knowledge Prerequisite: PHP, RESTful Webservices. 
* Nice to have: Joomla MVC, Swagger, Knowledge of APIs.
* Difficulty: Medium to Hard
* Mentors: Matias Aguirre [@fastslack](https://github.com/fastslack, Anibal Sanchez [@anibalsanchez](https://github.com/anibalsanchez), George Wilson (https://github.com/wilsonge)

## RFC: Request for Comments

* Status: Draft

This document is intended to describe the current state of the general conversation about the scope of the *GSOC 2017: Webservices in Joomla 4* project.

Since there were several previous attempts to implement *Webservices in Joomla*, the focus of this particular project is to achieve a working project to provide a REST interface for Joomla 4. Joomla 4 will be released with this project as a tool for the community benefit.

## MVP: Minimum Viable Product

### Project Definitions

This is the main list of features for the MVP:

* REST API for Joomla Content (com_content)
  - /api for Articles
  - List Articles (/api/articles)
  - Retrieve a Article (/api/articles/999)
  - Create a Article
  - Update a Article
  - Delete a Article

* **Development**
  - *External project from J4*. PRO: Freedom to develop and propose core changes
  - Inclusion in the Core: Time constraints and harder to be accepted. Difficult to evolve.

* **Extensibility**: other extensions must be able to add new entry points. REST API for Joomla Contacts (com_contact)
  - /api for Contacts
  - List Contacts (/api/contacts)
  - Retrieve a Contact (/api/contacts/999)
  - Create a Contact
  - Update a Contact
  - Delete a Contact

* **API Key Authentication**: authentication based on a general token. Generate a api key per user (in com_users for us) and use this in header for auth.

* **Business Models**:
  - *Current JModels*: The state of the models is currently tightly coupled (populate state etc.) to web stuff. Not channel-agnostic. PRO: They are throughly tested. For example: High level hacks for simple read operations. [https://github.com/mbabker/jdayflorida-app/tree/master/libraries/api/controller](https://github.com/mbabker/jdayflorida-app/tree/master/libraries/api/controller)
  - Mini-Service Layer: Create a clean layer. E.g. Article management via JTable, featured and frontend tables.
 
 * **Unit Tests**: The project must include tests.
 
 * **Interfaces**:
  - JModelInterface
    - getItem
    - getItems
   
### Nice to have

* User Interface to configure
* Backwards compatibility with J3

### Out of the scope

* ACL at field level
* OAUTH
* Service Layer

The REST API endpoints provide a new foundation for future core feature development, a facade layer that abstracts the inconsistencies of the past...*
